Trash can level measurement logic

variables

timeList = []*4  = List to store the values 
					START_TIME = 0
					END_TIME = 1
					TOTAL_TIME = 2

timerFlag = 0 Flag that indicates the measurement came down below the threshold

constants:
LoopSamplingTime = 2 secs
CriticalDistance = 50
NotificationTimeDelay = 15

steps:

step1 : Wait for the LoopSamplingTime

step2 : Check that Lid Cover is closed

step3 : Trigger the sensor to measure distance

step4 : Checking the previous distance with the present distance

step5 : if previous distance is not equal to the present distance send the present distance to the app

step6: if present distance less than criticalDistance,else set the Alarm to False and reset the timer Flag.

step 6.1 : check the timerFlag(Flag used to decide whether to start timer or not)

step 6.2 : if timerFlag is reset, set the current time to START_TIME.

step 7 : call the timer function

step 7.1 : set the current time to the  END_TIME

step 7.2 : check if timerFlag is reset

step 7.3 : if timerFlag is reset, set timerFlag and send twilio notification

step 7.4 : if timerFlag is set calculate the TOTAL_TIME

step 7.5 : if TOTAL_TIME is greater than NotificationTimeDelay 

step 7.6 : reset the timerFlag.
